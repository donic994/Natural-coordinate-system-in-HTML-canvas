# Natural-coordinate-system-in-HTML-canvas
 The Canvas HTML element has its own coordinate system with integer coordinates. However, if we want to draw curves given in natural coordinates, we must map the natural coordinate system to the coordinate system of the canvas element

 This was a project I did with my collegues for a Selected Mathematics Chapters. The documentation of the project is in Prirodni_koordinatni_sustav_u_canvas_elementu.pdf.
