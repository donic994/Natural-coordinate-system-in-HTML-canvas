# Natural-coordinate-system-in-HTML-canvas
 The Canvas HTML element has its own coordinate system with integer coordinates. However, if we want to draw curves given in natural coordinates, we must map the natural coordinate system to the coordinate system of the canvas element

This was a project I did for a Selected Mathematics Chapters.
